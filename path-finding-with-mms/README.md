## Let's find a path!!
Here, I've implemented BFS, DFS, Dijkstra in C++ 14 environment interfacing with ![mms simulator](https://github.com/mackorone/mms). Do have a look at the animation and then readon if you find this interesting! :) 

### Requirements to run this repository
- This implementation uses mms simulator to interact and visualize the robot/mouse movement. To learn more about the mms simulator used, please refer ![mms](https://github.com/mackorone/mms).
- The code base was developed using ![codelite](https://codelite.org/). It's opensource, so it won't take much of your time to install it ;)
- Make sure to compile and test the ![mms-simulator](https://github.com/mackorone/mms) with sample maps present in resources section of the simulator repo. Also familiarize with instructions on how to compile your own code with the simulator.

### Doxygen enabled 
- You can open the `index.html` file present in the doc section of this repo to view the doxygen generated documentation.


### Sample runs
- Dijkstra Algorithm in action!

- BFS in action!

- DFS in action! This is certainly bad performance! -- *To-Do [iterative deepening]*
